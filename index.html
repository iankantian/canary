                You're walking in the woods.<br>
                There's no one around,
                And your phone is dead.<br>
                Out of the corner of your eye you spot him,<br>
                Shia Labeouf.<br>
                <br>
                He's following you
                About 30 feet back.<br>
                He gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint.<br>
                He's gaining on you.<br>
                Shia Labeouf.<br>
                <br>
                You're looking for your car,<br>
                But you're all turned around.<br>
                He's almost upon you now<br>
                And you can see there's blood on his face!<br>
                My god, there's blood everywhere!<br>
                <br>
                Running for your life<br>
                (From Shia Labeouf.)<br>
                He's brandishing a knife.<br>
                (It's Shia Labeouf.)<br>
                Lurking in the shadows
                Hollywood superstar Shia Labeouf.<br>
                Living in the woods,
                (Shia Labeouf.)<br>
                Killing for sport,
                (Shia Labeouf.)<br>
                Eating all the bodies...<br>
                Actual, cannibal Shia Labeouf.<br>
                <br>
                Now it's dark and you seem to have lost him,<br>
                But you're hopelessly lost yourself.<br>
                Stranded with a murderer,<br>
                You creep silently through the underbrush.<br>
                A-ha! In the distance,<br>
                A small cottage with a light on.<br>
                Hope!<br>
                You move stealthily toward it,<br>
                But your leg! AH! It's caught in a bear trap!<br>
                <br>
                Gnawing off your leg,<br>
                (Quiet, quiet.)<br>
                Limping toward the cottage,<br>
                (Quiet, quiet.)<br>
                Now you're on the doorstep,<br>
                Sitting inside, Shia Labeouf.<br>
                Sharpening an ax,<br>
                (Shia Labeouf.)<br>
                But he doesn't hear you enter,<br>
                (Shia Labeouf.)<br>
                You're sneaking up behind him.<br>
                Strangling superstar Shia Labeouf.<br>
                Fighting for your life with Shia Labeouf,<br>
                Wrestling a knife from Shia Labeouf,<br>
                Stab it in his kidney.<br>
                Safe at last from Shia Labeouf.<br>
                <br>
                But Wait!<br>
                He isn't dead.<br>
                Shia Surprise!<br>
                There's a gun in his hand,<br>
                and Death in his eyes.<br>
                But you can do Juijitsu.<br>
                Bodyslam superstar Shia Lebeouf.<br>
                [ various gory details, you kill him with his own axe, etc... ]<br>
                <br>
                You limp into the dark woods,
                Blood oozing from your stump leg.<br>
                But you have won.<br>
                You have beaten Shia Labeouf
